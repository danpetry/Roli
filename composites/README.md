# About composites
This is a somewhat ugly "architecture" that lets the same module "guts" run inside a VCV plugin, and also turn inside our unit test framework (which does not link against VCV Rack).

You may look at the FrequencyShifter composite as an example.

## To make a composite.
Make a new class in the composites folder. This class is your composite class. This class must work in the test environment and the VCV Widget environment.

Templatize the class so that its base class is the template parameter. For example, in the FrequencyShifter class:
```
template <class TBase>
class FrequencyShifter : public TBase
{
...
}
```
Follow the link to look at [FrequnecyShifter](./FrequencyShifter.h)

Put all the Input, Output, Param, Led enums into the composite class, rather than the normal Widget class.

To use this composite in a test, derive concrete class from TestComposite
```c++
using Shifter = FrequencyShifter<TestComposite>;
```
Now you may use this class in a test. The TestComposite base class give your tests access to the inputs and outputs of your "widget"
```c++
    Shifter fs;

    fs.setSampleRate(44100);
    fs.init();
    fs.inputs[Shifter::AUDIO_INPUT].value = 0;
```

## How it works

The class hierarchy is something like these crudely drawn UML diagrams
```
TestWidget -> I/O
    |
    ^
   / \
   ---
    |
 FrequencyShifter<TestWidget> -> enums
 ```
 ```
 ModuleWidget -> I/O -> Module
    |
    ^
   / \
   ---
    |
 FrequencyShifter<ModuleWidget> -> enums
```
The purpose of the composite's base class is to provide the inputs/outputs/etc... to the composite. The TestComposite base class has vectors of I/O exposed as public members that the tests may directly manipulase. The WidgetComposite base class just marshals references to the I/O that is already in the VCV provided Widget base class.

All of the enums for module I/O goes into the composite. So they are available to tests as composite.ENUM_NAME. They are also available to Modules as this->composite.ENUM_NAME.
